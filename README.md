# Task_06_For-While-Do_loops
Lab 06 -Nested For Loop, While Loop

Lab Task
Note: Implement Each Task using nested loop and nested while loop.
Problem Statement:
Task 1: Write a C++ program that will print the following pattern.
*
**
*** **** ***** ****** *******
Task 2: Write a program to print a pyramid pattern with numbers where each row has incrementally increasing numbers.
1 
1 2
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5


Task 3: Write a program in C++ to print a pattern based on a user-input number of rows. The pattern should display increasing rows where each row i contains the integer i repeated i times.

Output:

 
Task 4: Create a program that outputs the days for a specified number of weeks. This will help you practice using nested loops in C++ and improve your understanding of iteration and output formatting.
Requirements:
1.	Define the Number of Weeks:
o	You should set the number of weeks to display to 3.
2.	Display Days in Each Week:
o	Each week should display 7 days.
o	Each day should be numbered from 1 to 7.
3.	Output Format:
o	The output should clearly indicate the week number followed by each day in that week, with proper indentation for readability.

Task 5: Letâ€™s consider a seating arrangement in a theater. Imagine a theater with multiple rows of seats, where each row has several seats numbered from left to right. If we want to display the seat numbers in each row.
There are 5 rows and each row has 10 seats. A nested loop can help us print each seat's number in each row.
